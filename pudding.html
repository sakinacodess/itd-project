            This banana pudding recipe is super special to me because it’s from my best friend, who’s honestly way better at baking than I am. She’s the kind of person who shows up to every gathering with something homemade, and this is one of her signature desserts. Once I tried it, I knew I had to keep it in my recipe collection. 

            The pudding is creamy, sweet, and layered with cookies and fresh bananas. It’s basically comfort in a tray and so easy to make. Start by combining 1 1/2 cups of cold milk and a can (14 oz) of sweetened condensed milk in a bowl. Add one package of instant vanilla (or banana) pudding mix, whisk it all together, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours so it thickens. 

            While the pudding chills, whip 3 cups of heavy whipping cream in a separate bowl until stiff peaks form. Then, slowly mix in the chilled pudding until everything is smooth and fluffy. 

            Now it’s time to assemble: in a tray, start with a layer of the pudding mixture, then add a layer of Nilla cookies, and then a layer of sliced bananas (you’ll need 5–6 bananas). Keep repeating those layers until everything is used up. Refrigerate the whole thing for at least 12 hours—overnight is best so the flavors really come together. 

            This dessert is always a crowd favorite and tastes even better the next day. Thank you to my bestie for letting me share her delicious recipe!
