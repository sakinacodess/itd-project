            These chocolate chip cookies are my go-to recipe whenever I want something classic, comforting, and delicious. They’re soft, chewy in the middle, and packed with melty chocolate chips. Trust me—these cookies never last long in my house! 

            To make them, start by mixing your dry ingredients: 3 cups of flour, 1 teaspoon baking soda, and 1 teaspoon salt. In another bowl, beat 2 sticks of softened butter with 1/2 cup granulated sugar and 1 1/4 cups brown sugar until creamy. This takes about 5 minutes. Then add 2 eggs and 2 teaspoons of vanilla and mix well. 

            Slowly add in your dry ingredients, then stir in 2 cups of chocolate chips. Once the dough comes together, wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for at least 24 hours. This step is totally worth it—it makes the cookies thicker, chewier, and so flavorful! 

            When you’re ready to bake, preheat your oven to 350°F and scoop the dough onto a baking sheet. Bake for 11–13 minutes or until the edges are golden and the centers are soft. Let them cool on the pan for a few minutes before transferring. 

            These cookies go great with a cold glass of milk or just on their own as a little treat. You can even freeze some dough balls for later, future you will thank you!
