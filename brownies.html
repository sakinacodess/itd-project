            This sweet potato brownie recipe comes from my older sister, who’s always looking for healthier versions of her favorite desserts. She made these one day and I was so skeptical at first—but once I tasted them, I was hooked. These brownies are rich, chocolatey, and honestly don’t even taste “healthy,” even though they totally are! 

            The base is 1 cup of mashed sweet potato, which makes the brownies super moist. Mix that with 1/4 cup maple syrup (or agave) and 1/4 cup melted coconut oil (or other cooking oil). In the same bowl, add 1/2 cup cocoa powder, 1/4 cup whole wheat flour, and a pinch of salt. Stir everything together until it’s nice and smooth. 

            Fold in 1/2 cup chocolate chips (or regular if that’s what you have). Pour the batter into a greased 8x8 pan and smooth it out evenly. Bake at 350°F for about 25 minutes, or until the top looks set. 

            Let them cool before cutting—if you can wait, they taste even better after a few hours in the fridge. These are the kind of brownies you can eat without feeling guilty, but they still taste rich and chocolatey enough to satisfy any craving. 

            I love having a batch of these on hand when I want something sweet but a little more balanced. Thanks to my sister for sharing one of her go-to healthy treats with me!
