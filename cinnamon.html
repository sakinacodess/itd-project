            These cinnamon rolls are another amazing recipe from my best friend—the same one who gave me the banana pudding recipe! She’s the queen of baking and always has her kitchen smelling like sugar and spice. These rolls are soft, gooey, and topped with the most perfect cream cheese frosting. I’ve been making them ever since she shared the recipe with me. 

            Start with the dough: heat 1 cup of milk and stir in 1/3 cup sugar and 1/3 cup butter until melted. Let it cool a bit, then dissolve a packet of yeast in it and let it sit for 5 minutes. Add 2 cups flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and 2 eggs, then mix until smooth. Keep adding flour (up to 5 cups total) until a soft dough forms. 

            Knead the dough, place it in a greased bowl, and let it rise until doubled (about 1 hour). Meanwhile, mix 1 cup brown sugar and 2 1/2 tablespoons cinnamon for the filling. 

            After the dough rises, punch it down and roll it into a big rectangle. Spread with 1/2 cup softened butter and sprinkle on the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Roll it up, slice into rolls, and place in greased pans. Let them rise again for 30 minutes. 

            Bake at 375°F for 20–25 minutes. While they bake, whip up the frosting: cream together 4 oz cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, 2 cups powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and 2 tablespoons milk.  

            Frost them while they’re warm and get ready for your kitchen to smell amazing!
